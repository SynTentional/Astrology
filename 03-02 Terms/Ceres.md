*In Her Emanation to the North, the Feminine Appears as Ceres Representing Her Procreative Aspectas Mother in Her Propagation and Nurturing of the Species*

The feminine archetype first manifests at the nadir (IC) as Ceres the mother. As such, she goes beyond Venus' sexual magnetisism which activates  the potential for life, by utilizing the creative energy or the procreative generation of physical forms. The mother nurtures the embryonic new life within her and then gives birth to the child. This nurturance continues until the child becomes independent and self-sufficient in its own right. Thus, the mother is also responsible for producing the foodstuffss which feed and nourish the propagation of the species.

As mother, Ceres also symbolizes the principle of **unconditional love**, (I think this is an important distinction, its' where we find *that* aspect of motherhood in the birth chart.) sustaining the nourishing newly created life forms. (It is important to note that in mythology, Ceres was both the compassionate nuturing mother and the angry, withholding mother.) Through her association with the Eleusinian Mysteries, Ceres also contains the secret of the great mystery of birth death and renewal, which speaks to the feeding and nourishment of the soul and spirit.

Ceres' outer color is green, symbolizing the abundant display of the vegetation of cultivated soil. Her inner color is blue-black, the color of the underworld where seeds lie dormant within the earth during winter incubation. Ceres' practical qualities also associate her with the element of earth.

In the symbolism of the astrological wheel, Ceres corresponds to the north position of the IC, representing the principles of foundation, roots, and family. (I think its interesting because now you can seperate the concept of the moon placement from the idea of nourishment and unconditionality, especially since the Moon is *very* conditional.) Astrologically, Ceres represents the ability to unconditionally love and accept yourself and others. When a person becomes excessively attached to their children creations, or possessions, Ceres' cycle takes them through the transformative process of loss and return. She teaches the wisdom that sharing and letting go lead to reunion. If one is fixated on the ceres process, he or she may experience abandonment and rejection in life, until learning to transform *grasping* into generosity.
In summation, Ceres is the lunar energy grounded through the physical reproductive organs where it procreatively regenerates and provides for fundamental human needs. Ceres is *mother*.

Ceres is quite literally Perspephone's mother, Ceres is *Demeter*, also expressed through the Egyptian *Isis*, and the Hesiodic *Gaia*, the Minoan *Rhea*, and the Buddhist *Tara*

# The Story of Ceres and Persephone
Long ago, Ceres and her beloved daughter Persephone wandered the earth together. So happy were they in each other's presence that they blessed the earth with a perpetual season of harvest. In this Golden Age, the world knew no deprivation, no winter.

# The Astrology of Ceres

*"To enter into the figure of Ceres means to be pursued, to be robbed, to be raped, to fail to understand, to rage and grieve, but then to get everything back and be born again"*

In symbolizing the function of mother in psychology, Ceres governs a number of psychological qualities thatr cannot be described by any one zodiacal sign. After spending a number of years observing how Ceres functions in the horoscope, the author has concluded that Ceres' attributes are best depicted by the signs Cancer, Taurus-Scorpio and Virgo. As ruler of Cancer, Ceres addresses the issues of how we give and rceive nurturance, how we develop feelings of self-worth, how we provide for and care for others, and how we respond neurotically if these needs are no met. As the ruler of the Taurus-Scorpio polarity, Ceres governs the lessons of attachmetn and aversion, the pathology of loss and rejection, the capacity for grief and sorrow, and the principle of sharing. And, as the ruler of Virgo, she addresses the issues of productivity, growth, self-reliance, and work.

## Ceres Love as The Basis for Loving Others
The ability to love oneself which originates in a positive Ceres mother-love and the child's receptivity to it also generates the ability to love others and to rejoice in their accomplishments. In cases where Ceres energy is either distorted or insufficient, a child can become self-rejecting instead of self-accepting. This produces a critical, judgemental attitude towards others and resentment over their acheivements. Buddhist philosophy teaches that to heal this attitude, one must develop compassion for others, a compassion that originates countless lifetimes each of us has mothered or has been mothered by all whom we encounter in the present incarnation. Thus, we must always remember and honor the inestimable service our mother performed in bearing, nurturing, and sustaining us by loving and accepting others. 
	This completely seperates the notion of self-love from Venus. It makes sense because I always assumed that I had no issue loving myself or others, yet something *else* is wrong with my Venusian nature as is indicated by my Venus/Saturn conjunction.
From an astrological perspective, this evolution from personal to universal love is symbolized by the three water sigs - [[Cancer]], [[Scorpio]], and [[Pisces]]. The initial stage of love associated with Cancer is the unconditional mother-love that gives rise to a strong sense of self-worth. When this self-esteem is operating, the person becomes able to successfully enter into the more complex sexual and conditional interactions of the second water sign Scorpio. The ability to unite on a one-to-one level provides the basis for the love of humanity developed in the third sign of Pises.
What occurs if this process is somehow disrupted? One such incidnet occured in the 1930s, when children began to be born en masse in hospitals. As a result, they were severed from the initial Ceres imprint of being held and nursed by mother. After being spanked under glaring lights, they were put in sterile cribs and given rubber-nippled bottles of sugar water as their food. This denial of the primary bonding experience is one of the factors that has contributed to this generations relationship difficulties and frustrations.

Yet, the individual who received a weak Ceres foundation is by no means doomed to loneliness or unfulfilling relationships. In order to heal the isolation and depression (two common Ceres ailments), he or she should seek counseling in order to build #self-esteem and thereby lay the groundwork for future successful interactions. These relationships, however, need not be limited to heterosexual intreractions. Indeed, Ceres mother-love may be given and received through a variety of forms -- e.g. homosexual and lesbian relationships, men's and women's support groups, and/or nurturing, platonic friendships.

**UNDERSTANDING MOMMY ISSUES**
My Mom is not a Virgo, but I believe that she represents some fundamental perception of 'other' that I have, informed by my descendant being in Cancer, the (seemingly) principal symbol of the mother, [[The Moon]].

## Growth and Productivity
![[Pasted image 20230509142955.png]]
In her pictograph, Ceres, goddess of the *grain*, carries a stalk of grain and wears a crown of wheat/corn. This image, of course, is identical to the one displayed in the image of [[Virgo]] the Virgin. This visual correspondance depicts the strong affinity between these two earth goddesses.

As ruler of [[Cancer]], Ceres provides food as a means of communicating love and acceptance. As ruler of Virgo, the food of the all-nourishing mother becomes the actual phyiscal nourishment that *builds, sustains* and *repairs* the celluluar structure of the corporeal body. This nutritional nourishment fostrs growth and enables the individual to work and function efficiently (Virgoan attributes). Ceres, the grain goddess, gave infant humanity the gift of agriculture. During the harvest season of Virgo, Ceres utilizes the resources of the earth sign Taurus to produce and distribute the vital life-sustaining foodstuffs to humankind. Thus, in the horoscope, Ceres is the significator of any and all vocations that involve the growing, distribution, preparation, and serving of food. (Hence, the charts of many farmers, cooks, and waiters and waitresses have Ceres/Virgo emphasized). (*I wonder  if Sam has this.*)

The maternal concern of Ceres insures the proper functioning of the body by instilling a personal concern for the health and hygeinic well-being of the body. Ceres also signifies the therapeutic use of food in healing (*like what I'm doing with TCM by trying Gingko Biloba! I'm seeing of of auspicious signs of thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis today :)*) Hence, Ceres-Virgo types will be drawn to healing techniques that employ vitamins, diet, and herbs. In medical astrology, since Cancer rules the stomach and Virgo the intestines (think Cancer = Storage, Virgo = Processing). Ceres related illnesses include: digestive imbalances, gastrointestinal disorders, and assimilation difficulties.

## Ceres and Efficient Functioning
Through physically nourishing and sustaining the body, Ceres imparts to it the capacity for work. This ability, ccoupled with the Virgo urge toward efficient functioning,produces a personality type marked by a strong sense of competency and self-reliance. These individuals will often devote themselves to some standard of excellence or excel at mastering the details of a chosen vocation.

When such a personality type becomes a parent, it becomes transformed into Super-Mom or Super-Dad - the strong, devoted, capable, and reliable parent. This individual identifies with both mother and father -- nurturer and provider -- and is capable of doing whatever is necessary to insure the survival of the offspring. Thus, it follows that the arrival of Ceres into the astrological arena (1973) corresponded to a marked rise in the number of individuals who conciously chose single parenthood.

For example, certain women are now opting for motherhood without becoming involved in a relationship or marriage. They will decide to conceive the child without informing the father, and raise it alone. The growing fields of genetic engineering and artificial insemination are furthrer decreasing the need for a relationship involvement in order for a woman to parent. On the other hand, an increasing number of men are feeling capable of assuming sole responsibility for raising their offspring. This has prompted many of them to apply for sole custody of children in relationship separations, to adopt children, or to stay at home and care for their children while the spouse works (e.g., John Lennon had Ceres square the Moon).

Astrologically, therefore, a prominent Ceres indicates the potential for one to conciously become a competent and effective single parent.

## **Ceres and Work**
Ceres, in her Virgoan expression depicts the ability and capacity to work. 

# Divided by Interest
				*below's sections have been chosen at will by me in order to patch together parts of my life.*

### Ceres in Taurus

Individuals receive nurturance through physical substance, a sense of stability, and being touched and held. In turn, they can nurture others by fostering their physical security and providing for them in tangible ways. Feelings of self-worth and acceptance are derived from learning how to provide materially for themselves. Imbalance results when the individuals overidentifies with substance and feelings of material lack promote excessive hoarding of possessions.

### Ceres in the Fifth House

Denotes the experiencing of nurturing issues through a strong involvement with childrren or the creative arts. One is nourished through play or putting onself in risky situations.
	
#### Chart Example

With Ceres in Leo in the Fifth house (a double-dose), Percy Bysshe Shelley spent his life writing love poetry and being denied his children trhough death and custody loss.

### Ceres-Moon Aspects

The nurturing principle combines with emotional responsiveness.
Ceres-Moon configurations describe a personality type who has a deep longing to be needed by others and to exhcnage emotional energy with them. With harmonious aspects, this need is fulfilled through selflessly giving to others and nurturing one's surroundings.
Stressful aspects point to the conflict between meeting one's own personal needs and those of the family. Other problems that may arise are separation anxieties, fears of rejection, and feelings of isolation.
This denial of emotional fulfillment can be healed if the individual becomes sensitive to the emotional needs of others and strives to forge an emotional bond/bridge with them which is mutually supportive.
#### Chart Examples

Queen Elizabeth, with Ceres conjunct the Moon in Leo, devoted herself to serving "our great imperial family."
Adelle Davis, with  Ceres in Sagittarius in the twelfth house opposed to the Moon in Gemini, taught people how to "eat right" and "have healthy children"
Luther Burbank, with Ceres in Capricorn trine a Virgo Moon, developed over 800 new varieties of plants.
Civil Rights martyr Martin Luther King, with Ceres conjunct his Moon in Pisces, dedicated himself to spiritually nurturing his race and all humankind.
