# Cancer 6th House
In the tropical interpretation of the [[Zodiacal Belt]], I have a Cancer 6th house.

**Advice**: Don't allow your emotions to get the better of you and alter your decision making.

Being emotionally in control is what helps my career out the most. By career, I clearly mean the day-to-day actions that make me who I am.

This includes studying, programming, working on projects and doing all of my work that is in my daily routine
