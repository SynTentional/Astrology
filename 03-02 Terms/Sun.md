# Sun

_My personal cupid, Apollo_

**Love**

The lord of my 7th House, [[The Sun]] sits in my 2nd House of personal finances & values.

According to a thread about finding love and why you should not use Venus as a way to achieve love, the lord of the 7th house will operate better as a means through which one can achieve the love they want, while Venus simply represents the manifestation of that love, what it will look like, when it arrives.

I can imagine that accomplishing what I want in love requires me to act in my Piscean way of being lovey, dreamy, romantic and poetic. Particpating in these activities will help me get the love that I want out of life.

Additionally, embodying the ego and representation of the sun will help me as well. Such as wearing yellow, gold and other solar themes.

Thinking more about this, I could integrate a lot more yellow into my clothing schemes as well. I haven't seen this _not_ work yet, but I also haven't seen it exactly work either. One thing that I did notice is that when [[JConr]] & I got together the Sun was sextiling my Venus.

More on this, Jupiter entering [[Pisces]] essentially gave birth to or sowed the seeds of this new relationship with [[Tom Battles]] . Furthering my theory that transits to my natal Sun create opportunities for relationships. So i can anticipate some relationships all throughout 2022.

## Sun in the 2nd House

My self-confidence and how I shine is directly related to how much money I can bring in. I can use creativity, poetry and the arts to excel in this area of life. I need to become confident in these abilities. I get a lot of my confidence through my friends and relationships so perhaps going out more will help me gain more confidence.

# Jyotish

Below lies Vedic interpretations for my Sun sign.

According to Vedic Astrologer Ryan Kurczak, the Sun is domicile in the 8th and exalted in the 4th. The ego or solar principle serves as a self-motivating factor that adds a large deal of integrity to the native's life.

This is indicative of the native not necessarily needing to be the leader in other people's lives, but rather to be the leader in their own life.

The Sun being debilitated in the 10th essentially makes the Sun a much more personal planet since it's exaltation in the 4th is correlated to a rather personal nature.

# Astrological Magic

The Days and Hours of the Sun are very good for perfecting experiments regarding [[temporal wealth]], hope, gain, fortune, divination, the favour of princes (does he mean the demon princes?), to dissolve hostile feeling, and to make friends.

# Kabbalistic [[Astrology]] 
The Sun is equally #warm and #dry. Its human qualities are clearness and sensitivity of the soul, *knowledge*, intelligence, majesty, beauty and vigor. On the negative side, it denotes vaulting ambition, attachment to wealth, garrulity, and excessive desires. In the natal chart it denotes laws and precepts, the union of society, fathers and half-brothers.


## Sun Dominant People are Good Counterbalances for Saturn Dominant People 
Emi is Sun dominant. 

## The Soul's Purpose is to Be Loved 
The Soul craves love. Perhaps Emi's deep desire for fame is, on a broader level to just be loved unconditionally due to how chiding his mother is. His solar nature is indicative of that, and he's found out ways to be charming to achieve what he believes is love.
