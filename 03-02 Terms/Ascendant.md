Valen's description: _The next 7° belong to Jupiter: lucky, petty, lurking at home, careless of his reputation, living in obscurity, fortunate in his children, misanthropic_.

**misanthrope**

-   _n._
    
    One who hates or mistrusts humankind.
    

This is generally a very negative deterministic interpretation.

According to the Sidereal Zodiac, my ascendant is at 25° Capricorn, putting it in the Dhanishta Nakshatra in the 1st Pada. The English translation of Dhanishtha is "Wealthiest" or "To Be The Most Famous / Wealthiest"

From my understanding, Dhanishtha Nakshatra has the energy of [[Saturn]] & [[04-00 Hobbies/03-00 Astrology/03-02 Terms/Mars]], which to me, makes sense in terms of goal accomplishments requiring energy (willpower) & discipline. The wealth association seems to be very interesting given recent scenarios where people have seen me as 'rich' or my life comes off as the life of someone who is wealthy to people who don't know me.

## Jyotish

In Vedic astrology, my rising is Capricorn in the Dhanistha Nakshatra.

This seems to indicate my presentation as being 'rich' or 'wealthy'. Some sources also state that the 1st house references conclusions about the world this is understood to me as a lot of my conclusions being about having a stable home, something that I did not have in childhood.

Whats interesting is how Saturn in the Aries 4th house indicates difficulty with Aries' spontaneous, violent nature. What worked for me was moving out, or utilizing Mars' severance to physically cut myself off from my family.

This could indicate that utilizing the Sign ruler of the house could be the correct answer for alleviating issues that are implied by the sign that rules that house. Someone once said that the sign ruler or lagna ruler is the "key" to that house.

Mercury, Saturn & Venus work in the favor of any Air or Earth ascendant. The Earth & Air signs are Knowledge and Service. Those born under these ascendants are not on the path of extreme spiritual experiences during this lifetime, but rather are here to be present in the material world. Fire and Water have more to do with Faith & Devotion. Expression inside the material world


Describes the temperment of the physiology of the person.
