Goddess Lakshmi is the Goddess of light, beauty, good fortune and wealth. As per Hindu mythology, she has been the consort of Lord Vishnu in all his incarnations, and thus, She also signifies love, grace, success and progress. A source of strength and the possessor of six highest divine qualities, the Goddess is not easy to please, nor she resides with anyone who is lazy or unduly greedy and believes in *hoarding*.

MahaLakshmi is also one of the three Tridevis (one among the 3 respective consorts of the holy Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva). Known to be the daughter of Bhrigu Rushi and the one reborn during Samudra Manthan, Goddess Lakshmi is also one the many forms of the highest form of Hindu Devi – Goddess Shakti – the eternal female force.

The lovely and inspirational Goddess, hence, is an integral part of the Hindu religion and culture. She embodies many divine qualities, and is worshipped and invoked on many occasions, including the most famous Hindu festival of Diwali (or Deepawali). Goddess is known to have many forms and as many as 1008 names, which are associated to her countless qualities and blessings.
