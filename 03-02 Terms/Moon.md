# Kabbalistic Astrology
The Moon is cold and damp, and leads all living things to mold and putrify.   Its positive human qualities are skill in magic and a knowledge of stories, plus a love of pleasure and an abundance of #food. On the negative side are excessive introspection (reminds me of [[Lilith]]'s promise to Eve in the form of an owl of self-reflection'), amnesia, phobia, indifference, and meditation in a mind lacking adequate knowledge. In the natal chart  it denotes the mother, the mother's sister, anyone's older sisters and *pregnant* women


# Whole Sign

Moon in the 3rd House:

-   Talking is used as a way of understanding and working out feelings, although the approach may be a rather intellectualized one.
-   Sometimes with this position, the mother has been so young or so _emotionally immature_ as to be almost a sister...

## Reparenting moon in the 3rd House

**Symptoms**

_the mind racing as you continually analyze your own performance. Bottled-up emotions get in the way of thinking clearly. Then, too, you worry all the time and are consumed with negativity._

**Remedies**

_Positive expression will consist of trying to get in touch with your feelings, perhaps writing letters to yourself regularly in a journal. It's also good for **analyzing your emo- tions, thoughts, and behavior, in order to change them.** A written inventory would be a good way to start. Devise a list of questions for yourself. **How are you really feeling today? If you're depressed or fatigued, what is so depressing, and why are you so tired?** Underneath, you may find that you're actually angry. If so, what are the steps you could take to change the conditions you're angry about?_

_~~this is fucking awesome~~_

## Aries Moon

_Cooking for myself/Eating Habits_

Cooking is done with a minimum of care, in favor of fast foods or those prepared quickly. Trying to rush, Aries Moons often burn food. The combinations eaten may contribute to irritability or emotional ups and downs, especially the old meat-and-potatoes model.

Cooking right can take far less time than you think, Aries Moons. Preparing twice as much of any dish and freezing the rest cuts cooking time in half.

Needs

Physical exercise, which comes naturally to many Aries types, is important for health and as an outlet for emotions and excess vitality.

~~seems redundant but okay~~

## Jupiter conj. Moon

There is a feeling that “things will get better” which sustains the person through the ups and downs of life - _an inner faith that is not always orthodox but is usually of a broad religious character._

In general, **they feel that life has meaning**, and this keeps them fully engaged in living wholeheartedly. There is at times too much concern about looking “noble,” to the point of vanity and self-consciousness about the impression they are making on others.

# Moon-Jupiter-Pluto: Archetype of Persephone

Queen of the Underworld Archetype: _"Tobias and Guy"_, _"Hades and Persephone"_

A passionate and expansive emotional nature, a deep and rich soul life, profound feelings of kindness and generosity, urges to use one's influence or opportunities to benefit other people, the ability to act as an emotional midwife, compassionate feelings for those in extreme process while also receiving support in turn, powerful catharsis followed by supportive bonding, healing waves of emotion, the emotional overhaul, the drive to find true satisfaction in life, powerful religious feelings. A deep renewal of one's feminine side, radical healing of family issues, the deconstruction of outmoded family patterns in order to progress, broken connections as grist for the mill, emotional fertilizer.

### Power-Centered | Power-Obsessed

I do measure things in term of power and find myself to be sort of power hungry. I think that the image of money + beauty is very moving for me...but the aesthetic of just pure celebrity...as in art and social status doesn't matter. People like Jeff Bezos have all the financial mobility. Elon Musk can control whether or not I live or die, it's something more interesting than celebrity. Scientific knowledge is a lot more attractive an artistic knowledge. Artistry does not really hold that much value to me which is why _doing_ art is something that I literally need to be reminded about. This is not to say that I don't value art at all, but it isn't valued as much as scientific empiricism...this just becomes more and more true as time goes on.

## Bounds

Valen's delineation: "...the six degrees of Venus [in Aries] are cheerful, skillful, radiant, proper, pure, fair-complexioned, even, pure, handsome

## Lunar Cycles

_With Cancer being my 6th house, the moon rules it. Thus making the moon's cycle's most applicable to parts of my life signified by the 6th house. These things include:_

-   Physical health
-   Routine
-   Pets
-   Work & Work environment
-   Techniques for self improvement

### Interpretations

Lunar cycles then can be interpreted as various cycles of manifesting self-improvement for my personal life. Full moons may be the climax or end period of a cycle where I have developed new modes of thinking and operating myself towards a positive mode of living.

It is wise to be concious, then, of habits that are present at both the Full and New phases of the moon.

Unconciously, i might be upset about the way my life is progressing during the New Moon phase and thus might be concerned with ways of bettering my productivity particularly towards my line of work.

3/28 Full Moon Notes

This lunar cycle seems to be very emblematic of my desire to become a much more commited programmer, as I am day 3/4 of my 'commit every day' task where I make atleadt one commit to my Github daily. This is definitely an achievable goal as even the most minute changes (such as a color scheme, or name change) contribute towards this goal, and so far I have been successful in this.

This matters because my skill as a programmer is highly connected to consistency in my craft. Learning and practicing new methodologies directly translates to my skill cap throughout my career.

I believe this will play out well as with this very small goal of just one commit per day, I can achieve improvement in my skillset in varying quantities per day. I can assume this will be higher in quantities during days where I have many assignments to work on, allowing me to commit varying degrees of efforts to multiple projects, thus allowing me to complete my goal.

This is highly dependent on having an ongoing project, which is easy as I have many project ideas goinf on many days all the time, with my budgeter being the main one that I am working on currently.

## Sales: Tech Sales

The third house rules sales and communication and now I have this job working in Tech sales as a Verizon sales rep where I sell Verizon phones to customers.

## Jyotish

### Moon as Ruler of the 7th House

_The moon in Pisces serves as the ruler of my Cancer 7th house. Indicating that communication is essential for my relationships_

Prolonged periods of no-contact and separation are to my detriment in these positions. I already experienced this when I went to Intel where distance between me and the one I was seeking a relationship from only served to deepend the divide between us.

Intellectual bonds are important to me (God, all of these Vedic pieces of wisdom hit **so** hard today.

This indicates that when looking for future relationships, I must prioritize us getting along on a communication level rather than physical.

More on this, with 7th house lord being 9 places away from my 7th house. My partner will most likely be someone with a deep cultural difference from me and could be met on a trip somewhere else.

When I make my 7th house page, I'll indicate these two factors that will help in looking for suitable partners:

-   Culturally different
-   Getting along mentally through communication.
-   They will be spiritual, philosophical and very Piscean (ethereal etc)

7th house (Cancer) lord exalted in the 5th house (Taurus).

By working on being stable, being reliable and taking care of my responsibilities. I can bring safety, enjoyment & clarity to my relationships.

# Astrological Magic

For those matters then which appertain unto the Moon, such as the Invocation of Spirits, the Works of Necromancy, and the recovery ofstolen property, it is necessary the Moon should be in a [[Terrestrial Sign]], viz.: Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn.

For love, grace, and invisibilkity, the Moon should be in a Fiery Sign, viz.: Aries, Leo or Sagittarius

For hatred, discord, and destructiojn, the Moon should be in a Watery Sign, viz.: Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces

For experiments of a peculiar nature, which cannot be classed under any certain head, the Moon should be in an Airy sign, viz.: Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius.

But if these things seem unto thee difficult to accomplish, it will suffice thee merely to notice the Moon after her combustion, or conjunction with the Sun, especially just when she quits his beams and appeareth visible. For then it is good to make all experiments for the construction and operation of any matter. That is why the time from the New unto the Full Moon is proper for performing any of the experiments of which we have spoken above. But in her decrease or wane it is good for War, Disturbance, and Discord. Likewise the period when she is almost deprived of light, is porper for experiments of invisibility and of Death.

But observe invioably that thou commence nothing while the Moon is in conjunction with the Sun, seeing that this is exteremly unfortunate, and that thou wilt then be able to effect nothing; but the Moon quitting his beams and increasing in Light, thou canst perform all that thou desirest, observing nevertheless the directions in this Chapter.

Furthermore, if thou wishest to converse with the Spirits it should be especially on the day of Mercury and in his hour, and let the Moon be in an Airy Sign, as well as the Sun.

Retire thou then unto a secret place, where no one may be able to see thee or to hinder thee, before the completion of the experiment, whether thou shouldest wish to work by day or by night. But if thou shouldest wish to work by night, perfect thy work on the succeeding night; if by day, seeing that the day beginneth with the rising of the Sun (perfect your work under) the succeeding day. But the hour you start your work is in the hour of Mercury.

Verily, since no experiments for converse with Spirits can be done without a Circle being prepared, whatsoever experiments therefore thou wishest to undertake for conversing with Spirits, therein thou must learn to construct a certain particular Circle; that being done surround that Circle with a Circle of Art for better caution and efficacy.
