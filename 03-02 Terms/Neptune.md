# Neptune in the 1st House
Neptune in the first means that I am a believer...and that belief is a huge part of who I am!

Neptune is the ruler of images, mirrors, reflections, cameras and (I personally believe) social media/networking on the internet. Due to the nature of Neptune being an astrological that has been recently discovered, we find it hard to have symbols that are invocative of his positive energy, although, the Neptune sigil does seem to do the trick in a way. 

## Reflections on Symbolism
Immediately, I feel as though I need a Neptune tattoo, but that makes me think about the association I had with the pride flag and various mythological creatures -- Neptune might turn me into a mermaid! I do not have any strong affiliation with mermaids outside of being a Pisces, but I do think that its poignant to point out that [[Alexander Manheimer]] is more of that kind of character due to his incessant swimming. I personally identify with being a Wizard...which feels more Uranian to me. Neptune is in Aquarius / Capricorn for me depending on how you look at it, but Uranus is closer to my ascendant than Neptune. 

## What to Do

I think that there is a way *magically* to resolve the problem outlined in [[Cameras hold a lot of energy even when not in use]] that involves developing an understanding of the astrological Neptune. It should also help me resolve my issue of being fooled in love and let down by misconceptions, but it will probably be a longer process and take a lot of reading. I do know that I have a book on it, and there might be some cookbook information on the internet that can help me understand it. Let's take a look

# Venus Square Neptune Natal
It's all about loving yourself (per AstrologyKing) however, I did see that [[Ceres]] talks a bit about that as well. 
I do feel a bit unloved by people and things around me, which is strange because I intellectually *know* that I have a loving family, but one of my love languages is touch so its crazy important that I have someone to touch me otherwise I will **not** feel loved. It's as simple as that. Unfortunately, I don't think that there's a way to synthesize that, so I have to like ask for hugs, it's crazy.

## Hugging Myself
I just hugged myself and it felt crazy good, I felt my body just straight up relax and I did it only for a second. I have developed -- now that I think of it, a hobby of crossing my arms when I walk down the street which does contribute to a similar feeling of hugging myself. I like this!

## Neptune Distorting my Self Image 
Neptune as an entity distorts my self image *greatly*. It makes me think that I am unlovable, and it is completely doing that. I need to establish a sense of control over Neptune as an astrological to move forward. I think a bracelet would help with this greatly. Repeating positive affirmations in the mirror works well too. Taking selfies is important as fuck because that is an exportable good that I can use to get clout on the internet.
I just took a few selfies *while* saying positive affirmations and it did improve my mindset.

## Being Blind to Faults (Sexual Slavery)
Dark, but very real. A sense of autonomy is lost when I distort my self-image that makes me *romanticize* being a sex object or sex slave. I think it's manifested in [[Luke Maier is a Vampire]], but I'm not sure because some part of me does like being bitten independent of being held captive.

# The Psychic Use of Images in Creation 
I have noticed, particularly yesterday, that inserting images into my writing *greatly* enhances my understanding of the topic. For some reason this brings to mind the idea of a [[Coon]] but I'm not entirely sure what that word means outside of it being someone making fun of how sensitive my body is. The only person who perceives that is other Pisces though, which is why Andre brought it up -- I hope to help me. 
Regardless, inserting images into my Obsidian journal has greatly helped me develop a better understanding of astrological principals.

## Not Saying Anything Negative in Front of a Mirror 
What is essential to understand is the psychic implications of mirrors. I should **never** say anything negative in front of a mirror as the mirror captures the word and makes reality have to *do* with what I just said. I also feel the same about phones and perhaps this relates to [[Black Mirror]]. Negative thoughts and emotions can be quite literally captured and transmuted alchemically through reflections. This is a fact. So even on my computer I should be wise about what I say.

## Aquamarine as a Neptune Stone 
Luckily for me, I am already wearing a Neptune stone and it's [[30-15 Documentation/20-01 Metaphysics/20-02 Astrology/20-02 Terms/Aquamarine]]. It's great because I can essentially feel the healing that it's making for my issues regarding image and self love, and now that I have accepted it..it will happen a lot faster! This is a good reason to keep the stone on.
