# Tuesday is Mars' Holy Day 
I am of the school of thought that the planets in your 10th house are the one's who should be revered the most as well as the one whom has the most direct impact over your life over the long term. That is Mars for me, so I should take a sabbatical on **Tuesdays** instead of Sundays since that is the day of observation of the fact that the Sun is not the ruler of my life, Mars is. 

Mars might also be the ruler of *gay men* in particular as this day came up for [[Javier]]when we were having our little back and forth [[2023-05-20]]. Saturday is for reverence to women for me, as it is an acknowledgement to that which we are ultimately slaves to. For them it's women, for me, it's study. Mars rules my 4th and 11th houses.



I am at my best when I am working towards and ambitious goal. My ambitious goal is to create my perfect eternal digital world and live within it soberly and gingerly.

# Assorted Aspects in My Birth Chart

## Mars Square [[Uranus]]: Impatience

It is hard to focus ambition and concentrate on one subject, is restless, impulsive, impatient, and likely to change jobs or drive a lot in life. Can be easily irritable and unpredictable in temper. May have a lot of internal conflict towards their libido and intimacy.

The ADHD placement, this makes it hard to focus on projects and is probably why I had such a hard time at Make School and with computer science in general. Mars' energy is just combined with Uranus' eccentricity and lack of focus. Oddly enough I have amazing staying power and grounded-ness but a hard time focusing.

I do have a lot of inner conflict about libido and intimacy but mostly with romantic relationships which is why it's hard for me to put my finger on what exactly it is.

## Mars Stationary:

Mars stationary in my birth chart makes me have a distinct inability to express my anger outwardly. It is advisable for me to take part in activities that allow me to act aggressively in order to be more successful in the martial areas of my life.

The correlative and causative effects of this aspect of my life plays a role through career, philosophy, and speech. There is a distinct need for me to play fighting video games ad they allow me to express my anger rationally without hurting anyone.

Playing aggressively in video games can circumvent issues regarding anger, sexuality and competitiveness and help me manifest various career opportunities for myself.

## Mars Square Vesta:

Can resist what is good for their mental, spiritual, and emotional health. Feeds off of overly intense and passionate energies to make them “feel good”. This could be by winning something, dominating another, sexual gratification, or the high of challenges

This manifests very much in my obsession with having thse intense conversations with people at bars! Literally makes me a psychic vampire!

Beware All Who Enters the World of Squares

Mars is basically snatched up with troubling aspects which will amount to outer circumstances forcing inner growth (as opposed to Trines which are situations that manifest naturally). Additionally, sextiles require activation, meaning that I need to do something to make the good stuff happen. All throughout life, I'll need to constantly battle these difficult situations with Mars (and Neptune) related issues.

## Notes on Mars and Men

Mars relates to violence and the will to power. What's interesting is that [[30-15 Documentation/20-15 Software/Storj - Cloud Storage/Uplink Stuff/2023-04-26]] I thought about how there's this expectation of violence from men that happens whenever I think of making any sexual advances that prevents my desires from being fulfilled. I believe that it may be an astrological...who am I kidding, it is something that can be diagnosed astrologically, which means that I may be able to heal it while also using astrological principles.


# Astrological Magic

"In the Days and Hours of Mars thou canst make experiments regarding War; to arrive at military honour, to acquire courage; to overthrow enemies; and further to cause ruin, slaughter, cruelty, discord; to wound and to give death.""

# Kabbalistic [[Astrology]] 
Mars is hot and scorchingly dry, corresponding to flames, death, devastation, rebellion, massacre, and war. Its positive elements are #strength, #victory, and #power. Negative influences leads to excessive wrath, failure to keep one's promises, larceny, and cruelty to others. In the natal chart, it refers to brothers.
