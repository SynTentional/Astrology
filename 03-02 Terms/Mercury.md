Wednesday is Mercury's day.

I should spend Mercury days reading, writing and analyzing data.

[[My Natal Mercury is In Retrograde, What Do I Do]]

# Kabbalah of Astrology 
Mercury is mixed and variable, changing according to other planets with which it is in aspect, and according to the constellations. (Remember, Mercury is the messenger, who carries information but *rarely originates it.*) Mercury refers to the soul of man and to man's powers of #comprehension. On the positive side it leads to clarity of thought and speech, education, wisdom, [[Astrology]], accuracy of expression and talent for composing #poetry and #prophecy. In its negative phase, it leads to *excessive argumentation*, resorting to trickery and the forging of documents. In the natal chart it denotes any messenger of intermediator.
