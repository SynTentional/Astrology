Saturn or [[Shani]] is the ruler of Capricorn in [[Greek Mythology]]. In astrology, Saturn is **associated with restriction and limitation, ethics, justice, career, achievements in life, virtues and values as well as long term planning or foresight**.Scientifically Saturn takes about 29.5 years to complete its journey to the sun and is famous for its glazing rings.

I love Saturn tbh, ever since having the Saturn statue I stopped sleeping with older men as much. Theres something about genuinely loving what a planet represents that allows the planet to manifest more heathily to you.

Saturn relates to mastery, solemnity and legitimate feelings of melancholy. Mastery can never be accomplished by humans, that is for God, but, it can be taught and the path shall be laid out by Saturn or Shani.

You cannot escape melancholy through pleasure, you can either choose to go to the Jupirerian world or deep into Saturn's dark cave of introspection.

I'm not sure what happens when you go into Jupiter's realm. Is that "running away from your problems"? I think that it is. Very simply.

# The Universe  Has Been Swept Into Cosmos : Little Cosmology Lessons 
Each individual has their own unique principals and values which they then feed to their **personal computer** which attends to the need of materializing their imagination behind the scenes. Only one's right with God can do this, as imagination is powered by belief and believe requires chastity, limitation, punishment, torture, and especially...coming into the light.

## Tiny Little Metaphors 
Often times things feel like tiny little metaphors for times past. Like emotional intelligence is just an abstract perception of time and everything is on a warp scale. The potential to think about astrology this way has allowed me to transcend the time/space barrier through being a ***Technomancer*** a skill line only available to gay black men. 


# Ruler of the 1st Conjunct Venus

Likely to be charming and possibly even lazy. Could likely attract benefits through ones charming nature and may have a need to please others. Social graces. Artistic eye and possible talent

> With time, the aspects of Saturn intensify...indeed, Saturns aspects intensify with age.

Every 3 years, Saturn aspects intensify. The 10th aspect of Saturn is where we are the strongest in dealing with Saturn.

## In the 4th

Protective of my mother (very) my mother is a strong support in my life. I create a persona through my home environment, giving myself private time, putting down roots and getting involved in family tradition

### Square to Neptune: Hypersensitivity

This means that I can't drink or do drugs. This also might elude to why crystal bracelets and crystals in general work so well for me. Perhaps staying at home for some type will contribute to a better / healthier emotional state.

### 4th from Saturn - Vedic Astrology Tid Bit

A place of emptiness. A place where ai will have two things in that area of life that would be acting as one.

In my case I have Alex and Luke as these two very straight guys who I have very empty feelings towards.

> 4th from Saturn (my 7th house) is a place where the native will never be able to understand if this thing is real or not...things will mysteriously come and go..things I never expect.

4th from Saturn doesn't necessarily become a karmic part for us. It becomes a shadowy part of us. We cannot figure out what we can achieve when something is 4th from Saturn.

In the context of relationships I'm just gonna do whatever because if this means I'll never know whats "right" or "not right" for manifesting the right type of guy then I literally need to stop giving a fuck. Stop doing in reference to other people. Stop worrying about the type of people involved in certain things and just give myself permission to like what I like.

### 12th from Saturn: Things that come later

Saturn has an issue with his feet, this is why he is slow. Due to this, 12th from Saturn is a place of much injury. For me this is my 3rd house where Sun, Mercury, Moon and Jupiter appear. Things at Saturn's feet (12th from Saturn) will take time. Time to achieve, will take time to develop, and will take time to develop. 3rd house of early education, siblings and communication (ruling over so many other areas in my chart due to the stellium) will start at my 33rd year of life. It will climax at my 36th year before it goes steady.

Saturn will start lessening it's effect of that drag of EVERYTHING after my 33rd year. Until then, it will frustrate me and dampen my spirit. Once I'm at this point of maturity, then I will achieve what I need to achieve.

### 6th from Saturn: Where I HAVE to Serve

I have to serve the 9th house. That seems to be the father? I'm not sure how to serve my father. I should spend time alone and not be impacted by the world or social media...then the answer, and astrology will bloom.

9th house is religious instincts, spiritual values and good karma....thats a good thing to serve...sounds like God.

I think this relates back to what the Yodha app said about how I should just study spirituality. Get really into understanding it and that is how I will serve the needs of the Dharma Bhava (9th House).

## Saturn Returns: General

When Saturn returns to the point it was where the native was born, a lot of the natives character traits and contributions to society become more tangible. Saturn solidifies things and allows them to take physical shape and it does this by making aspects to various planets in the birth chart. Once the Saturn return happens, all planets have been in all aspects by Saturn and the birth chart becomes fully activated.

# Astrological Magic

"In the Days and Hours of Saturn thou canst perform experiments to summon the Souls from Hades, but only of those who have died a natural death. Similarly on these days and hours thou canst operate to bring either good or bad fortune to buildings; to have familiar Spirits attend thee in sleep; to cause good or ill success to business, possessions, goods, seeds, fruits, and similar things, in order to acquire learning; to bring destruction and to give death, and to sow hatred and discord.""

cc [[2. OF THE DAYS, AND HOURS, AND VIRTUES OF THE PLANETS]]

# Kabbalistic Astrology
Saturn is cold and dry, denoting #death and #destruction, #weeping and #grief, and *all ancient things*. It does have positive influences: #astuteness of mental faculties, the ability to meditate on death and mysteries, a knowledge of Secrets, worship of the Lord, and *the power to dominate men*. Its negative aspects include isolation from man, conquest and pillage of others, overbearing #anger and the betrayal of his fellowman. In a natal chart it denotes fathers, grandfathers and the deceased.

# Saturn does NOT like white people

[[Zophikiel]] is the angel in charge of Saturn. As soon as I type his name I feel a reverberation in the balance of my foot. Safqiel is another way to pronounce it, or Zaphiel. No image found on Angelarium

Regulation of "that which submits, rules"

# Saturn as "Doing the Bad Things to Do", Understanding Personal Limitations 
Pranks is the twisted version of what Saturn does. Evil power, puts own pride at risk. Peridot heals from this. I usually thought this tendency was martial due to an understanding of men and violence seems to be indicative of this.

Concerns what makes society and oneself harmonious. Strongly believes in putting down the ego. Comfort in commune, cults, hippie lifestyle, communal ideologies. Suchlaph. California surfer dude!!!!!!! Mimics the lifestyle of the agori's. Birava worship. 
#Penance 
Rahu and Saturn finds a lot of issue with how society is run. Sub-culture. #AlternativeLifestyle #LargeEgo Overcoming large ego.
Comfort, extreme relaxation. Diffuse each situation to act as though they have no worries but actually feels uncomfortable. Craving something to come and limit them. Craving #definition 

'Hick' character. Pranks. Being good at machinery and tools. Owning large properties. Agricultural Nakshatra. WILD COUNTRY GUY. Testing limits, being bad. Lots of endurance to engage in laws and utilize discipline when they believe in what they follow. Lots of athletic ability. Lots of understanding of words. Pouring over the simplest expression of spirituality. Learn from experience. Collecting little tidbits of experience. Knowledge gained through living, knowledge gained through old life. Distilled wisdom from elder making life feel more simple and experienced. Harmonious disciplined life. Longevity. Shani/Saturn/Longevity. Long life.

Yielding, Ketu Men control Saturn men. Lead cult communes/modes of spirituality that Saturn men are attracted to. Women believe that she's giving something to the Ketu man the KETU MAN IS THE VAMPIRE. 

Reckless force. Needs a steady and unwavering woman. Helpful in suppressing own needs and desires. Saturn men are loose, wild, and frustrating. Brotherly, reckless, non-considerate straight men are like this. I'm curious about this from a queer perspective.

## Darkness of Ash 
[[Uttara Bhadrapada]]  is after the depths of the valley.
Winged celestial serpent. Dragons begin as snakes and transform into dragons with age. Representative of the kundalini growing through the body in life. It's like the energy of the earth slowly moving into your body. 

## Saturn's Tendency to Make Natives Submit 
The paradox of submission bringing true freedom and individuality is shown in Jyotish through the exaltation points of Saturn in Libra and the Sun in Aries, opposite one another. Sun's exaltation in Aries of the soul is allegorical for the soul's craving of love. The Sun *craves **freedom***, Saturn *needs **freedom*** Saturn's exaltation in Libra is allegorical for true freedom being *submission to* that which we love. For me it is a vampire or something. The weaker the Saturn the more attraction to painful ways to submit the ego. Submission should be out of love and towards that which we love. The way that you surrender to love is to destroy the ego or, colloquially [[Ego Death]].
