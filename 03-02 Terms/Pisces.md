Pisces is a sign on the [[Zodiacal Belt]]. It is one of the 12 popular zodiac signs in [[Astrology]].

Before, I used to think that being a Pisces was a bad thing.

Now it has advanced to an understanding of two fish..

Now it has advanced into an understanding of [[Double Consciousness]]

It also relates to [[Spirituality is Real]] and something else that I can't think of now. I used to think being a Pisces was about hearing #voices .

One of the lunar mansions in Pisces is [[Uttara Bhadrapada]] which is ruled by [[Shani]] or [[Saturn]].

[[Feeling like I'm cursed]] is a real thing that happens with Pisces


There are a few reasons why Pisces might feel like they're cursed.

-   **They are highly sensitive.** Pisces are one of the most sensitive signs of the zodiac. They feel everything deeply, both the good and the bad. This can make them more susceptible to negative emotions, such as sadness, anger, and anxiety.
-   **They are idealistic.** Pisces are also very idealistic. They have a strong sense of what they believe is right and wrong, and they often set high standards for themselves and others. This can lead to disappointment and frustration when things don't go according to plan.
-   **They are empathetic.** Pisces are very empathetic. They can easily feel the emotions of others, and this can sometimes be overwhelming. They may feel like they are constantly taking on the burdens of others, which can leave them feeling drained and exhausted.
-   **They are creative.** Pisces are very creative. They have a vivid imagination and a deep appreciation for art, music, and literature. However, their creativity can also be a source of pain. They may be plagued by creative blocks or self-doubt, which can make it difficult for them to express themselves fully.

If you are a Pisces who is feeling cursed, it is important to remember that you are not alone. Many people feel this way at some point in their lives. The key is to find healthy ways to cope with your emotions and to focus on the positive aspects of your life. With time and effort, you can overcome your feelings of being cursed and live a happy and fulfilling life

None of this has to do with the self outside of the fact that I myself am a Pisces.

Being a Pisces makes me creative which explains why I could be one of the first people to discover use cases for [[Priming]].

Because I am sensitive, this relates to [[Having White on the Screen Improves Reading Comprehension]]

I guess the last question to ask is whether or not Pisces hear ghosts. I have no probable cause to believe that it's a Pisces thing.

# Kabbalistic [[Astrology]] : Sun Sign Delineations
***Pisces: Water, Feminine, Nocturnal, North*

*General*: Pisces will have a medium-sized but #broad-chested body, black eyes, and a #serene forehead, a white complexion. Pisces will have a weak voice; will be #irritable but not preemptory, #polite but #deceitful, and indulge #freely in food, drink and sleep.

*First Decan*: Narrow-chested, but beautifully proportioned shape and facial characteristics
*Second Decan:* Short and hirsute, this Piscean will have a prepossessing appearance, and will be hostile to all.
*Third Decan*: Auburn hair and beautiful eyes, this Pisces will have the misfortune to be ill quite often.

*Controls*: Feet and toes
*Ills*: Feet and toes, plus hemiplegy (paralysis of one side of the body), leprosy, and itching

### Personal Opinions 
I believe that the Auburn hair bit speaks more to the Sidereal or Vedic zodiac being more accurate. Claire Brookes, whose tropical sign is Aries but whose sidereal sign might fall in the later degrees of Pisces has this "auburn hair".
Me myself, per my own register am born during the 1st decan of Pisces making my face beautiful :)
