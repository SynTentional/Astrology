Alright baby, me time! This planet is right smack dab in my 1st whole sign house, just 4 degrees away drom my ascendant, accompanied by Neptune, Part of Fortune & Ketu... two shadow points and two outer planets in a Saturn ruled sign.. I think it's finally time for me to dive in.

Uranus is the first of the outer planets in Astrology, representative of science's ability to expand what we already know.

Uranus in the first house makes you unusual in every way: you are original, have a lot of great ideas, and perfer to look and be different than others. You feel different too, you often feel like you have a **special purpose but it's often hard to find what it is, _especially in youth_**

You often experience sudden changes, and you are always changing too. Some people would say that you are unpredictable, and you can be shocking them from time to time. Uranus in the first house suggests that you **come across as smart** and someone who always has a new thing or two to say. With harmonious aspects you are able to influence others for the better.

With Natal Uranus in the first house, you are and original thinker and innovator. All the Uranian qualities become here visible to anyone who meets you. People see me as unique, independent and non-conformist. Freedom is important to you and **rules have to make sense for you to follow them**. If they don't, you're not afraid to break them.

Self expression and **being authentic** is another priority high on Uranus in the first house people's list. You have a strong sense of who you are and you want to let others see it. People with this placement struggle in circumstances where they have to wear a uniform or that has strict rules about what you should look like.

-   Currently (August 2021) Uranus responds to Venus who was in a very strong position in Libra. Venus essentially dictates the affairs of Uranus since Venus has control over what goes on in Taurus.
