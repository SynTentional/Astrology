### _What is this journal about?_
	*astology is like using math to construct the universe, but in reverse*

Personal. A lot of this holds the purpose or seems like it'll be based in me predicting things, which I'm not about.

Predictions often don't excite me, however, I can say that I have not explicitly said 'this will happen exactly on this day' in my life. All of my predictions so far have been general trends happening over long periods of time such as a stock increase.

Other times, it's me trying to find a simple 'skeleton key' situation such as buying a statue, consecrating an altar, or wearing a specific color consistently in order to achieve some type of result such as a relationship, money or otherwise.

I think this whole thing about me not worrying about tried and true predictions and hypotheses comes from the fact that I am, by definition, training to become an engineer, not a scientist. I'm not really that interested in the theory of anything really. I want to see validation & results. **I am a problem solver and I use astrology to solve my problems.**

This all remains true, but as of a recent revelation, I have decided to pursue greater understanding of Vedic Astrology or Jyotish, as it has been of much greater utilitarian use to me. Saturn has been beneficial, despite Traditional Western Astrological techniques leading me to believe that Saturn is essentially a bad guy with no merit. I appreciate the teachings of Jyotish much more because from what I've seen / understood, each planet servers a purpose in one's life.

# Vedic Astrology

I tend to enjoy Vedic astrology because the approach to understanding it is a lot more structured and less based on abstract ideas of gods. There is a very clear system that I can work with.
