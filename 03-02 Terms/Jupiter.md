# Astrological Magic

"The Days and Hours of Jupiter are proper for obtaining honours, acquiring riches; contracting friendships, perserving health; and arriving at all that thou can[st] desire.""

cc: [[2. OF THE DAYS, AND HOURS, AND VIRTUES OF THE PLANETS]]

# Kabbalistic Astrology 
Jupiter is warm and moist and corresponds to life, increase of #well-being, #productivity and #development, and the growing soul. Its positive elements are supporting the rule of law, seeking good of his fellowmen, serving in the courts of law and the courts of the Lord. Negative elements can lead to *talking too much*, seeking too much wealth, and seeking too much the approval of his peers. In the natal chart it refers to children and grandchildren.
