Generational Astrology is a field of astrology that **focuses on planets that affect an entire generation of people**. The **generational planets** are the **outer planets** **Uranus**, **Neptune**, and **Pluto**, and potentially **Sedna** and **Quaoar**. 

These planets take so long to complete their orbits that everyone born within a multi-year period will have that planet in the same sign.

A **horoscope** at the time of birth for a person (or an event) provides the most critical astrological insights. Generational astrology can help you understand the unique characteristics of your generation and how they relate to the world around you/
