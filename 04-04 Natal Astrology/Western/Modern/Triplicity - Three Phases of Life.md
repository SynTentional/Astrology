The life is generally thought of to consist of three phases - youth, maturity, and old age. These also very nicely and strikingly parallel the three different modes of the zodiac signs (the triplicities), cardinal, fixed, and mutable.

Please note that this is just **a** way of looking at life and astrology together and certainly not **the** way of looking at astrology and life together.

## Cardinal - Mars - Young Boy
Starting things, initiating projects, being young and immature. Perhaps the Sun sign here can indicate the general age of the soul in relation to other aspects of a person's birth chart.

The entirety of life is constructed around relationships, as the relational planets are present here. Sex, hormones and intense emotions make up most of the person's self-esteem and with this configuration, mistakes are certain due to lack of wisdom of oneself. 
One thing that I think about this is how it typically resolves itself, in heterosexual parings to the story of Ares (war God) and Aphrodite having secret affairs behind Hephaestus' back only to be caught by him, trapped by a golden net that presumably that cannot escape from and being mocked by the rest of the gods. 

## Fixed  - Sun - Mature Man
Establishment of solid ideas, core principles through which one operates out of that must be established in order to be productive in society. For me, it is all of my writings that I am doing, composing themes and solidifying structures and systems that work for me that I do not expect nor want to change at the time.

The Mature man here learns that all of his life is determined by what he thinks of himself and how optimistic he is being in the moment.

The Mother here learns that attention to her own body and her cycles and flow is arguably (because I do not know for sure as I am not a woman) more important than adherence to any particular version of herself, positive or not. She begins "mothering" in the sense that she tends to and cares for the needs of her offspring. While not necessarily children, the metaphor is most highly displayed there or perhaps with the regular watering of plants.

## Mutable - Jupiter - Wise Old Man
Old structures tend to stop being *relevant*. "Memory isn't the first thing you lose with age, it's **relevance**". Adaptability to the changing environment is key.

In men, the ego starts to expand in order to be creative and bountiful in society. In women the self begins to contract and give way to the destructions of systems she relied on in her life.
