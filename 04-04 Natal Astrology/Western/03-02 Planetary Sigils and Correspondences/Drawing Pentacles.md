[[2023-05-21]] I drew pentacles to [[04-00 Hobbies/03-00 Astrology/03-02 Terms/Mars]] the [[Moon]] and [[Saturn]] in order to achieve my goals. I did this by buying inking pens from Blick and getting to work at my desk in my home. 

I feel like they worked because yesterday a *bunch* of shit popped off.
