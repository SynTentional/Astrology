# <u>Pluto Square Venus Saturn conj. - Overview</u>
**<u>Key Terms</u>
- Pedophilia
- "Ignorance is Bliss"
- Feminine Power

## <u>Feminine Energy as a Fundamental Force in the Universe</u>
*Key Terms* Receptivity, Flow, Laziness, In-Action

There is certainly an aspect of being that prefers to and is productive in being receptive to the energetic exertion of other entities. To believe that objects act independently of one's own reasoning abilities is to free oneself of the concept of "living in a simulation" which is where we find **Narcissism**, and **<u>Pride</u>**.

##### <u>Minstrelsy</u> as the Foundation of My Desire to Side With Black Women on the Things that Matter 
![[Pasted image 20230625182518.png]]Anxiety in my head produces recursion of negative ideations. 


### <u>Pedophilia as a Bar from Entry</u>
*God loves you, just not enough to save you* -**Ethel Cain**
As pedophilia gains prominence in the American eye, we begin to see the ways in the <u>true self</u> or <u>higher self</u> is obstructed by <u>jealousy</u>, which, as we know is the **thief** of Joy. 
**Pedophilia**: or a desire to have **sexual** relationships with <u>children</u> as an **adult** 

##### Heterosexuality as the Reinforcement of Pedophilic Values
Power being in blood/blood-lines. Forced marriages between powerful bloodlines. Colorism is the <u>cause</u> of this because blood is red when it is outside of the body and blue when inside.

##### <u>Femininity in Men Being the Result of Being Molested</u>
It just kind of twists up your arm.

### <u>Ignorance is Bliss</u>
Absolving yourself of your reasoning abilities is the key to survival for all men in general. Each man has selective reasoning in the ways in which he <u>absorbs</u> information, processes it, and utilizes it. It is best utilized when directed towards essential information that is conducive to the things that you are interested in.

##### <u>Hatred</u>
Concerning yourself with hatred and the things that you hate does affect a person, but eventually the hatred can be whittled down into an object in one's own home that is bothering them and can be broken, removed, etc.. acted upon like any other object. 



#### <u>misc.</u> 

### <u> Personal Observations</u>
- Understanding this is the road to <u>power</u> which is contained in <u>Mars in Libra</u> (Mars in Scorpio Tropical) due to the mutual reception of Venus and Mars.
- Something about this is Luke. However, I'd prefer not to be with him, he died in my eyes.
