**Yoni Consort:** [[Uttara Phalguni]]
**Caste:** Warrior/Ruling Caste 

Stable expansion. Steady growth. Poise, control, lightness.


Saturn represents: stratification. Class. Mercy.

I was born of the snake around my throat. Revisited once.
Cold feminine virility of the feminine aspect of Pisces. Through the *lens* of a Saturnian perspective, which is variable. 

Saturn PROTECTS Pisces. Beyond definition.

The winged serpent nakshatra. The queen who has achieved the highest worldly position through her feminine sexual powers. [[Uttara Bhadrapada]] is feminine virile energy which is has a cold, reptilian quality to it, symbolized by the dragon of the depths. Has the power to gain and manipulate reality without physical force (sexual power, pure feminine receptivity)

Notable [[Uttara Bhadrapada]] natives:
- Kim Kardashian (Moon) 
- Jefferey Epstein (Moon) 
	- His connection to *Victoria Secret* (think, [[Venus]] as the expression of that type of beauty) CEO, billionaire Les Wexner allowed him to control Lex's wealth from the shadows, like a *financial consultant* perhaps. Lex gave power of attorney to Epstein over his financial affairs. The duo of Les Wexner and Epstein were described as having one mind together. 
		- Lots of this connects to Ketu controlling Saturn men, Saturn men controlling women. However, Wexner had a [[Uttara Bhadrapada]] Moon with a [[Purva Phalguni]] Sun.
- Bill Gates (Moon) 
- George Soros (Moon) 
- Hilary Clinton (Moon)
- Alexandria Ocasio Cortez 
- Anna Wintour (Moon) (Possible)
- Tyra Banks (Moon)

This nakshatra seems to instill within others a fear that they are being *controlled in a way that they cannot perceive*. [[Uttara Bhadrapada]] natives use their special form of service for elevated social climbing normally. 

This is the Nakshatra of the **Cosmic Queen**, so there is a feminine nature to this sign, even when it is present in the charts of men. Feminine in the extent that it is able to receive and then control, expand, and direct what one receives.

Shaped by a very Saturnian stepmother. 

## Titan of *Industry* 
Think Kim Kardashian. The way a rich man's wife invests herself in the family's wealth expenditure. The rich man, that is, is [[Uttara Phalguni]]. Lots of waitress/waiter/waiting metaphors present in these people's live's. AOC was a waitress before becoming a politician.
