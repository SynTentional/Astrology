There's a bunch of different astrology softwares available. Most of them being paid for although I do have a torrent of SolarFire v9 loading metadata right now.

This could be useful because it could give me a centralized place to store all of my data and perhaps it can link with Obsidian for ultra-fast efficiency. I can buy it now for $350, but it would be a gamble. I'm also not sure what I want to do with it yet. Here's a link to SolarFire v9

I do need to buy solar gold or some software in order to be more efficient on my computer. Perhaps this will be one of my goals once I become a financial consultant.
